1: Code Refactor

Description
For my first assignment, I have updated both the html and css code to reflect semantic HTML elements, with the goal of making an accesible web page. Referencing HTML Semantics, I converted div elements to section, header, and aside elements where relevant. I also structured HTML elements in a logical structure, as well as added in alt descriptions to all images.
